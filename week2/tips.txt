1) Use:
    with open('test.txt', 'r') as f:
        file_contentes = f.readlines()

So that we don't need to close the file after (f.close() is not necessary)

2) iteration in a list when we want the index as well:
    names = ['joao', 'henrique', 'oliveira']

    for index, name in enumerate(names):
        print(index, name) #will print: 0 joao \n 1 henrique \n 2 oliveira

3) zip function: allows to loop in two list once -> it creates a tuple with the respecting values and we unpack them as the loop goes.

    names = ['peter parker', 'bruce wayne']
    heros = ['spider man', 'batman']

    for name, hero in zip(names, heros):
        print(f"{name} is actually {hero}") # Will print: peter parker is actually spider man ...

4) Instead of input("password: ")) use "from getpass import getpass" this is a library for getting passwords (like in shell)

5)if else one line:
x = 1 if True else -1

# in Python 3.5+

x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}

z = {**x, **y}
>>> z
{'c': 4, 'a': 1, 'b': 3}
